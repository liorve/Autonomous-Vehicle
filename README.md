# Autonomous Vehicle (Final Degree Team Project)

This project is an autonomous vehicle developed for a final degree project. <br>
It uses an ESP32 microcontroller and features lane detection and pathfinding. <br>
The vehicle relies on a mounted camera for navigation, using visual data to detect lanes and make decisions. <br>
A web-based control panel is included for managing tasks and monitoring the vehicle.
